function [pdf] = calculate_pdf(image_descriptors, centers)
%==========================================================================
%   CALCULATE_PDF: returns descriptors extracted from  densely sampled
%   regions.
%
%   - Argms:
%       * image_descriptors:
%       * centers:
%
%   - Procedure:
%     After we make the appropiate modifications to the image (get the 
%     greyscale, single and smooth it) we find the frame features with
%     vl_dsift. This has two hyperparameters; binSize and magnif. 
%     Then we make the appropiate actions for each color space.
%     For 3 channel images, we get the descriptors for every channel and 
%     then stack them next to each other.

image_descriptors = single(image_descriptors);
pdf = [];

for i=1:size(image_descriptors, 2)
    
    dist = vl_alldist(image_descriptors(:,i), centers);
    [~, k] = min(dist);
    pdf = [pdf , k];
    
end
